NUCommon
========

Common, useful or helper classes that I've written at various times or are writing. Predominantly C# but 
possibly supporting other languages as I get around to writing for them.

I'd appreciate if you linked to this github repo in your application's credits section if you use any of the classes 
here, but if this isn't possible in your solution (e.g. if you don't have a credits section and it is not feasible 
for you to do so) then send me an email at: nick.udell+GitHub@gmail.com and if I like what you're doing I'll probably 
give you permission. I'm a reasonable guy. I also appreciate seeing cool new projects using my stuff so your chances
are strong.
